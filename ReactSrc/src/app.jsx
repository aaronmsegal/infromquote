In 2014, under new CEO Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's U.S. finally broke a nearly two-year streak of growth-free quarters on the comparable sales front. But that recovery is tenuous: it is still struggling to get people into its stores, and it has suffered from out-of-stocks and customer service that many find wanting. Last year saw a lot of turmoil: it replaced the CEO of its $288 billion U.S. division and lost its chief merchant. But the company has made strides in improving the quality of fresh food in its stores\u2014about 55% of revenue comes from grocery. Its e-commerce investments are paying off too. Still, Wal-Mart is grappling with ever more aggressive rivals like Target and Amazon, the proliferation of dollar stores and a desire for healthier grocery offerings, meaning 2015 is a key year for McMillon to prove he can modernize Wal-Mart.", "C.
